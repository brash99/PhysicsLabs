    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, there are a lot of calculations of the uncertainty in a derived quantity, based on the uncertainties in the raw quantities involved.  We can understand how to calculate these uncertainties using just a little bit of calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function, $z = f(x,y)$.  We imagine that $x$ and $y$ are two independent raw quantities measured in the experiment, and $z$ is some derived quantity.  The appropriate way to calculate the uncertainy in a derived quantity will depend, fundamentally, on the $type$ of uncertainty:  instrumental (uniform), or counting experiment (Gaussian), for example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain-rule of differentiation, together with an assumption that the uncertainties are $uniform$ in nature (such as, for example, one typically has in the experiments in this lab course), lead to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\delta z = \\left| \\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} \\right| \\delta x + \n",
    " \\left| \\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} \\right| \\delta y\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the function $z = \\frac{x}{y}$.  This particular relationship will be very useful in this experiment!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of density in Equation ([1](#mjx-eqn)) will require a determination of the mass and volume of each rod. The\n",
    "final density will be an average of the computations for each method of measuring the volume of the cylinder. We\n",
    "will need the uncertainty in the computed density. Using Equation ([2](#mjx-eqn)), we can show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho} = \\frac{\\delta m}{m} + \\frac{\\delta V}{V}\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A second extremely important concept in this experiment is the calculation of the weighted average of a series of numbers, each of which has an uncertainty associated with it.  For example, imagine that we make four measurements of the same quantity, $x$, and have an uncertainty, $\\delta x$, for each of these four measurements.  The questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What is the $average$ of these four measurements?  \n",
    "(b) What is the $uncertainty$ in this average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when we average a series of numbers, we simply add up the values and divide by the total number of values:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when each of the measurements has an uncertainty, it is not so simple.  The idea is that we want to attach more importance to measurements with $small$ uncertainties, and less importance to measurements with $large$ uncertainties.  This is called calculating a $weighted$ average.  For Gaussian uncertainties, it turns out that the way that we do this is to calculate the average as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i} {\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $w_i$ are weights associated with each measurement.  For the case of uniform uncertainties, we have that $w_i = \\frac{1}{\\delta x_i}$.  For Gaussian uncertainties, we use $w_i = \\frac{1}{\\delta x_i^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if $\\delta x_i$ is small, the corresponding weight in the sum will be large, which is exactly what we want!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculation of the uncertainty in $\\bar{x}$, there are $TWO$ separate concepts related to uncertainties that we must consider.  The first is that there are uncertainties in each of the raw quantities that are being used to calculate the weighted mean.  This uncertainty is a $systematic$ uncertainty.  But also, there is uncertainty that comes from the notion that the actual $values$ of the individual measurements are not all the same. Since this involves the concept of the statistical fluctuation of repeated measurments of the same quantity, this is a $statistical$ uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics of calculating these uncertainties is actually quite complex and involved.  For the purposes of this course, we are going to simply report the final results of this mathematical exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\delta \\bar{x}_{systematic} = \\frac{N}{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We should, then, combine these uncertainties together into a single uncertainty on the weighted average.  The usual technique is to combine these two errors together either linearly, in the case of uniform error measurements, or\n",

If you simply drop a mass into the water and let it sit at the bottom of the beaker, the weight you will measure will simply be the weight of the water plus the weight of the mass.

Even if you don’t break the graduated cylinder, you will splash water out of the cylinder which will make your measurement unusable. For this reason, **tilt the graduated cylinder as much as possible and allow the metal cylinder to gently slide down the glass wall.** Be certain that the metal cylinder is <u>completely dry</u> before putting it in the water and ensure that it is fully submerged before you take data. Record the difference in water volume readings.
