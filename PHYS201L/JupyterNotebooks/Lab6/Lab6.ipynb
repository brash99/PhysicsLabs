        "- To learn how to estimate and propagate errors\n",
        "- To learn how to take measurements to verify a theory\n",
        "- To experiment with collisions\n",

        "- One Collision table set up with Spark Timer and Carbon Mat\n",
        "- A number of recording sheets\n",
        "- One protractor\n",
        "- One 30 cm ruler\n",
        "- One scale\n",

        "- <u>**Electrical Hazard**</u>: The Spark Timer generates dots on the recording sheet by passing high voltage from one puck, through the carbon mat, to the other puck.\n",
        "    - The red and black cables <u>must always be securely connected</u> between the Spark Timer and the Table and they <u>must be in good condition</u>.\n",
        "    - Do not depress the foot switch without both pucks on the table.\n",
        "    - <u>**Do not touch the metal pucks while the footswitch is depressed.**</u>\n",
        "    - Alert your instructor if the cables are in poor condition, are not remaining seated, or if the <u>sparking is clearly audible</u>.\n",
        "- Use the <u>least possible force</u> when sending a puck along the table. Ask your instructor to help you assemble a rubber-band launcher if you prefer---they will give you more reproducible results as well.\n",
        "- Do not touch the latex tubes connecting the compressed air distributor to the air pucks. Latex is damaged by oils and UV light (it is also possible---though unlikely---that you might have an allergy to latex).\n",
        "- <u>Do not depress the footswitch until you are ready to take data</u>. Leaving a puck in one place for longer than 20 seconds while generating spark data can damage the carbon mat.\n",

It is not necessary that they Velcro actually adheres to the puck, but as long as it is wrapped tightly enough, it won’t come off.\n",
