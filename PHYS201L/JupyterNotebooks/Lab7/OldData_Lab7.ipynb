    "- To learn to take good measurements\n",
    "- To learn how to estimate and propagate errors\n",
    "- To learn how to take measurements to verify a theory\n",
    "- To learn how torque is related to angular acceleration\n",
    "- To learn how moment of inertia depends on both mass and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment\n",
    "- One Assembled Angular Acceleration Station\n",
    "    - One “A” frame base\n",
    "    - One 1-m steel rod\n",
    "    - One CI-6538 Rotary Motion Sensor\n",
    "    - One “Super Pulley”\n",
    "- One PASCO “Mass and Hanger Set” (ME-8979)\n",
    "- One 2-m length of thread\n",
    "- One “Hoop and Disk” assembly\n",
    "- One “Point Mass” assembly\n",
    "    - One mounting rod with captured screw\n",
    "    - Two cylindrical masses with nylon thumbscrews\n",
    "- One meter stick\n",
    "- One measurement caliper\n",
    "- One OHAUS scale\n",

    "### Safety\n",
    "You will be rotating fairly heavy masses to somewhat high rotational velocities. Above all else,\n",
    "you should ensure that all masses are **securely attached** to the rotor and you should be aware of\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "Newton’s second law, $a=F/m$, describes mass as that which resists acceleration. Rotational\n",
    "motion is very similar to linear motion in that a kind of force called a torque will cause an object to change its rotational velocity, $\\omega$. What resists such a change is not the mass of the object alone, but the way in which that mass is distributed. This combined effect of mass and its distribution is called the moment of inertia, *I*."

    "### Torque\n",
    "Torque is the “force” which causes an object to change the rate at which it is rotating. Examples of this kind of motion are: starting, stopping, or changing the “speed” with which a wheel is rotating; bending your arm at the elbow or leg at the knee; or even screwing (or unscrewing) a bolt or screw-top lid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to remove a securely fastened bolt, you quickly find that it is much easier to use a\n",
    "wrench than it is trying to use your hand alone. The force you can apply to the bolt is, itself, not enough to cause the bolt to turn. But the force you can *apply* times a distance away from the\n",
    "center of rotation (often called the “lever arm”) is directly related to the magnitude of the torque you can generate (i.e. how effective you will be at getting the bolt to turn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it seems obvious, it must be mentioned that not all forces are equally effective at generating torques. If you push or pull the wrench towards or away from the bolt, this will not cause the bolt to turn and you will generate no torque. Only the component of the force which is perpendicular to the lever arm has any effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We roll all three of these concepts into the equation\n",

    "Where $\\Gamma$ is the torque, $r$ is the distance from the point where the force is applied to the center of the axis of rotation, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$."

When you take your measurement, you should look carefully at each data set. The “noisier” the data, the worse your uncertainties will be. But if the angular acceleration data is not the proper data set to use, how do you get angular acceleration from the other data sets? You must fit your “good” data and use your knowledge of kinematics to extract the acceleration (and its uncertainty) from the fit."

    "### The Effective Torque\n",
    "Now that you’ve read through the whole lab hand out, it is important to notice that friction contributes a torque *opposite* to the torque you are applying. Your effective torque is, of course, the difference between these two torques and this is the torque you should be using to compute your moments of inertia. But how do you determine the torque due to friction?\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical frictional torque is given by equation ([3](#mjx-eqn)) if we know the angular acceleration and the moment of inertia of the system. You can measure the angular acceleration due to friction by measuring it right after the system has been spun up by the hanging mass. Simply use Capstone to record the data right after a run while the system is still spinning (although this might be done after *every* run, time constraints might make it more appropriate to measure it one time for each of the two systems). Ten seconds of spin-down measurement should be sufficient. The moment of inertia should be the theoretical one you can compute by knowing the masses and dimensions of the system."
